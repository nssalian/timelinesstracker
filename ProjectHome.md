# Airline Tracker System #

The objective is to develop a piece of software that is capable of using real time flight information of airplanes to monitor different aspects of their flight patterns. Elements of special interest include on-time arrival of airlines, airline performance, airport efficiency, and other interesting statistics around length of trips and on-time arrivals. On-time arrival of airlines refers to being able to show what are the on-time or delayed arrivals of different airlines per geographic region (you can define many geographic regions as desired). This can help to identify arrival patterns for each airline in different geographic regions. Airline performance refers to identify what airlines are the best performers in terms of meeting their original schedules. Another important aspect is to identify airport efficiencies, for example if equipment and services are limited at an airport, airlines may be circling around the airport for some time until resources on the ground are made available. Analysis of these data can indicate which airports are stressed to the limit vs other airports that may have enough resources. Other statistics that may be interesting is identifying if there are any patterns in distance travelled and on time arrivals, or traveling from one geographic region to another shows interesting time patterns or also monitoring the altitude of airplane flights is correlated with weather.
